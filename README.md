Psychwish

A self-discovery web app that helps users transform vague wishes into grounded clarity. Psychwish helps reconnect you with your desires, understand yourself, and begin your journey to your dream life. The user completes a psychology quiz which determines their personality archetype, they are then prompted to input their wish to which the AI responds with a comforting sentence to acknowledge where the user is currently and confirm their goal. After asking “ so your goal is to… right?” the AI will generate a simple plan of action for the time frame the user selects: either short term (1 month) or long term (1 year). This information is stored in a database and an anonymous ranking of common wishes is displayed  so that users do not feel alone in their goals, and they are also provided with a page of resources and people they can contact to make their dream a reality. The AI will then generate a theme tune to represent their dream life once they have completed the goal to motivate the user and this will update when the user updates their wish/ goal.

Psychwish empowers users by combining psychology, emotional validation, and AI planning tools to create meaningful momentum. It is both a reflective space and a motivational tool designed to make dreams feel real, supported, and within reach.
 During our teenage years there's a lot of emotions and new experiences that can confuse us yet people are pressured to start choosing things for their future like their career etc. We also recognised that at many other stages of life people can feel lost and be aimlessly wishing for things to change without actually doing anything like using wishing well, but what if the wishing well could transform our dreams to reality, with our input of course. 

A very human trait is the almost endless desires we have and the ability to be motivated and ask questions fuelled with emotion which AI is unable to do. However we can collaborate with AI to add some clarity to our deepest wishes so they don’t get stuck at the bottom of a well. Questions have such tremendous power… the same way using the right prompts is essential with AI, asking ourselves the right questions can be transforming and help you find the right solutions, prioritize, and even increase your self-awareness. Psychwish combats the ideal of “empty wishing” or helpless feelings with lack of clarity or a way to move forward. By combining emotion, clarity, and action, it’s designed to help users feel less alone and more connected to others as well as what they truly want.

We used Next.js and React, alongside Tailwind CSS, to build the user interface, incorporating html and css. We also used figma for the design element of our web app.

We are submitting Psychwish to all 3 tracks with our primary track being the creative one - collaborate with the machine.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
