# Psychwish
**From vague wishes to grounded clarity.**

Psychwish is a self-discovery web app designed to help users clarify their desires, reconnect with their personal goals, and take actionable steps toward building their dream life. It transforms abstract wishes into grounded, personalized plans through psychological insight and AI guidance, it’s built to feel - to validate, comfort, and inspire


## Key Features
### Psychology-Based Quiz
Users begin by taking a personality quiz to determine their psychological archetype.
This helps personalize the tone and guidance of the app's responses.


### Wish Input & Emotional Reflection
After the quiz, users enter a personal wish or goal. The AI responds with a comforting and affirming message, acknowledging their current emotional state and confirming their desire (e.g., “So your goal is to... right?”).

### Goal Planning with Time Frames
Users choose a time frame:

* Short term (1 month)
* Long term (1 year)

Based on the chosen time frame, the AI generates a simple, personalized plan of action to help the user begin working toward their goal.

### Wish Database & Anonymized Trends
User entries are saved in a database. An anonymous ranking of common wishes is displayed, helping users feel supported and less alone in their aspirations.

### Supportive Resources Page
Users are provided with relevant resources, tools, and contact links to people or organizations who can help them move forward with their dream.

### Personalized Theme Tune
The AI generates a custom theme tune to represent their dream life and keep them motivated. The theme tune updates with each new goal which is input after the user completes their previous goal


## Purpose of PsychWish
Psychwish empowers users by combining psychology, emotional validation, and AI planning tools to create meaningful momentum. It is both a reflective space and a motivational tool designed to make dreams feel real, supported, and within reach. During our teenage years there's a lot of emotions and new experiences that can confuse us yet people are pressured to start choosing things for their future like their career etc. We also recognised that at many other stages of life people can feel lost and be aimlessly wishing for things to change without actually doing anything like using wishing well, but what if the wishing well could transform our dreams to reality, with our input of course. 

### AI for Hummanity
A very human trait is the almost endless desires we have and the ability to be motivated and ask questions fuelled with emotion which AI is unable to do. However we can collaborate with AI to add some clarity to our deepest wishes so they don’t get stuck at the bottom of a well. Questions have such tremendous power… the same way using the right prompts is essential with AI, asking ourselves the right questions can be transforming and help you find the right solutions, prioritize, and even increase your self-awareness. Psychwish combats the ideal of “empty wishing” or helpless feelings with lack of clarity or a way to move forward. By combining emotion, clarity, and action, it’s designed to help users feel less alone and more connected to others as well as what they truly want.


## How It Was Made
We used `Next.js` and `React` to build our web app. We also used `Figma` and `Tailwind CSS` for the design of the user interface.

## AI vs HI Hackathon
We are submitting Psychwish to all 3 tracks with our primary track being the creative one - collaborate with the machine.
